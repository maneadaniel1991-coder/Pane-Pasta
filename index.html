          <h2>From Italian kitchens to London offices.</h2>
          <p>
            After years cooking in Italian kitchens and running high-volume restaurants in London,
            we wanted to strip things back to what really matters: honest recipes, proper technique, and food that still tastes like Italy when it reaches your desk.
          </p>
          <p>
            Pane &amp; Pasta starts as a <strong>dark kitchen in Hammersmith</strong>, focusing on office deliveries and corporate catering.
            Every sauce, every tray of focaccia and every portion of fresh pasta is made from scratch by people who grew up with these recipes.
          </p>

          <h2>Two Italians, one very hungry city.</h2>
          <p>
            Pane &amp; Pasta was born from two Italians who grew up with Nonna's kitchen as the centre of the house:
            a wooden table, a pot of sauce that never really left the stove, and people constantly arriving hungry.
            Moving to London, we saw how often food is rushed, over-complicated or made far away from the kitchen that serves it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our dream is simple: take the kind of food our Nonne would proudly put on the Sunday table - slow-simmered ragu,
            fluffy focaccia and bowls of pasta that actually fill you - and make it reachable on a normal lunch break,
            a Tuesday night on the sofa or a weekend with friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're starting in a dark kitchen in Hammersmith so we can focus on cooking instead of decor.
            We'll deliver to offices, co-working spaces, homes and hotels in the area - anyone who wants real Italian comfort food without the fuss.
